### **What is a Code Review?**

A code review is a common software quality assurance activity that involves reading and evaluating the source code of a program or feature. Code reviews can be carried out while the author is in the process of writing it or upon its completion. At least one of the people performing the review must not be the codeâ€™s author.Code reviews are also sometimes referred to peer reviews.

### **Why perform a Code Review?**

- Ensures uniform design and implementation - Performing regular code reviews promotes a consistent coding style which increases code readability and makes it easier for someone who may join in on the development process to understand what has been done so far. If there are multiple individuals working on a project , the different styles may clash and the code can quickly become messy and unorganized which can affect its functionality.

 - Guarantees quality code that meets requirements - A team of developers may have different interpretations of the projects  requirements.Performing regular reviews of each team member's work can make sure that all team members stay on track and aren't spending valuable time working on something that isn't required or necessary.

 - Optimizes performance - Junior developers on new team members may not be aware of code code optimization techniques used by the team. The peer review process gives them an opportunity to improve their coding skills and thus the performance of their code.

 - Facilitates team learning - Sharing different techniques and technologies between team members can be an efficient way of overall improving the quality of the project. Regardless of seniority or experience , each team member may have something to positively contribute to the project that other members may not know about.

- Minimizes the impact of mistakes - Anyone who has spent time coding has experienced migraines or strained eyes from sitting , looking at their work too long. Code reviews offer a fresh set of eyes to analyze the code and eradicate any bugs before the problem gets out of hand. This ensures the project can progress more efficiently.
