### **What is a Code Review?**

A code review is a common software quality assurance activity that involves reading and evaluating the source code of a program or feature. Code reviews can be carried out while the author is in the process of writing it or upon its completion. At least one of the people performing the review must not be the codeâ€™s author.Code reviews are also sometimes referred to peer reviews.
