### **What is a Code Review?**

A code review is a common software quality assurance activity that involves reading and evaluating the source code of a program or feature. Code reviews can be carried out while the author is in the process of writing it or upon its completion. At least one of the people performing the review must not be the code’s author.Code reviews are also sometimes referred to peer reviews.

### **Why perform a Code Review?**

- Ensures uniform design and implementation - Performing regular code reviews promotes a consistent coding style which increases code readability and makes it easier for someone who may join in on the development process to understand what has been done so far. If there are multiple individuals working on a project , the different styles may clash and the code can quickly become messy and unorganized which can affect its functionality.

 - Guarantees quality code that meets requirements - A team of developers may have different interpretations of the projects  requirements.Performing regular reviews of each team member's work can make sure that all team members stay on track and aren't spending valuable time working on something that isn't required or necessary.

 - Optimizes performance - Junior developers on new team members may not be aware of code code optimization techniques used by the team. The peer review process gives them an opportunity to improve their coding skills and thus the performance of their code.

 - Facilitates team learning - Sharing different techniques and technologies between team members can be an efficient way of overall improving the quality of the project. Regardless of seniority or experience , each team member may have something to positively contribute to the project that other members may not know about.

- Minimizes the impact of mistakes - Anyone who has spent time coding has experienced migraines or strained eyes from sitting , looking at their work too long. Code reviews offer a fresh set of eyes to analyze the code and eradicate any bugs before the problem gets out of hand. This ensures the project can progress more efficiently.


### **How to perform a code review?**

- Author self assessment - Ensure the owner has read through and left comments in the source code before submitting to the team. This can minimize defects and save time.

- Define quantifiable outcomes - When clear goals are set , it increases each member's accountability. Avoid vague statements such as “fix bugs”

- Create a system to record outcomes- Quantifiable metrics or data is what is needed in order to assess how effective the team code review process is.

- Have set time allocated - Make sure sufficient time is given for the review process .Typically a code review should not be longer than 1-1.5 hours. Its should be done slowly so details are not missed.

- Review all project documents - Project requirements and design documentation should also be reviewed so that all team members are clear on what that assignment is asking. 

- Take regular breaks - Take breaks every 20-30 minutes. You should not review more than 300-500 lines of code an hour.

- Ensure identified bugs are fixed - All defects that are identified must be fixed as soon as possible. 
 
-  Use the opportunity to improve the skill of all members-
Code reviews are a great opportunity for each member to expand their knowledge , correct their bad habits and further their review capabilities.

- Don't take the back seat - Trust your team and don't make life harder by over analyzing their code and work through the process.

- Carry out smaller reviews at regular intervals - If the team is aware that their code will be reviewed frequently , they will be more inclined to review it themselves before its submission.

- Utilize code review tools - This increases efficiency and accuracy and optimizes the time spent by your team members reviewing the code.

- Use checklists - By using checklists like this one , remind the reviewer and author on what to be looking out for while conducting a code review which will improve their personal coding abilities.

### **Do’s and Don'ts of code reviews**

#### **Author**

##### **Do:**

- Be polite
- Be thankful
- Clarify any solutions you don't agree with or don’t understand directly.
- Leave explanations where suitable for code that is complex and or spans multiple pages or classes.
- Have descriptive , meaningful commit messages.
- Commit your changes after the code review to show the team what has changed.
- Answer as many comments as possible and give thanks when it's due.
- Acknowledge comments even if you don't agree with them.

##### **Don’t:**

- Strive to improve
