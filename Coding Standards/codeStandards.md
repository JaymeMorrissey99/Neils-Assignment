# Coding Standards

## What Are Coding Standards?
Coding Standards are a set of guidelines, best practices, programming styles and conventions that developers adhere to when writing sources code for a project. All bug software companies have them enforced.

A coding standard document tells a developer how they should be writing their code. Instead of every developer writing in their own preferred style, they write all code to the standards outlined in the document.

This makes sure that all large projects are coded in a consistent style and ensures easier readability and avoids confusion between developers.


## Advantages of Implementing Coding Standards
- Offers uniformity to the code
- Enables the create of reusable code
- Makes errors easier to detect.
- Improves readability, makes code easier to maintain
- Improves programmers efficiency, helps generate faster results

## Helps Collaboration
As much as you might like coding by yourself, there comes a time when you will have to share your production with others. There’s also the possibility you will have to look at their code — especially working in a team, where second opinions are vital to a great-working product. This is when you’ll realize that not everyone writes their code the same way, and you’ll start to think everyone but you is doing it wrong.

## Writing Code that’s up to Coding Standards
Coding Standards aren’t a clear-cut thing, as everyone has a different idea about them. These can differ between coding languages. There are a few basics everyone should follow though.

## Formatting
Make sure you make the appropriate indentation, add proper amounts of whitespace and continue on new lines to ensure your code is readable. Take naming conventions into account when creating new files.

## Portability
It’s extremely important that your code is written in a way so it’s easily moved between platforms - no hardcoded values - these would break when used in other platforms.

## Modularity
Try and write code that’s usable by itself and doesn’t rely on anything written by someone else. These dependencies can break easily.

## Style Guide
If you work as part of a team, consider creating a style guide that leans heavily on common code conventions. Consistency is always more important than following the rules.

## Naming Classes
The name of a class should purely be a noun. A class represents an entity in a software application. A class should not consist of more then one word. An example: naming a class “Car” instead of DrivingCar.
