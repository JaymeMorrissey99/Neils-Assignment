# Coding Standards

## What Are Coding Standards?
Coding Standards are a set of guidelines, best practices, programming styles and conventions that developers adhere to when writing sources code for a project. All bug software companies have them enforced.

A coding standard document tells a developer how they should be writing their code. Instead of every developer writing in their own preferred style, they write all code to the standards outlined in the document.

This makes sure that all large projects are coded in a consistent style and ensures easier readability and avoids confusion between developers.

- Offers uniformity to the code
- Enables the create of reusable code
