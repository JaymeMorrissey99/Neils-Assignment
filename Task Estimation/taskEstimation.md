# Task Estimation

Task Estimation is the Scrum technique used to estimate the length of time a piece of work will take to complete.

The objective is to estimate the amount of time a user story will take to complete based on the priority, complexity or scale of a story and by the time box of the Sprint.

Story Points are the designation given to the amount of time to be allocated to a user story. Story Points are used to understand the relative levels of effort for a user story in comparison to other user stories.

It is important during task estimation to calculate the amount of work the team working on the sprint can achieve during the timebox of the sprint.

To calculate the number of story points a team can complete during a sprint you add the number of days each team member is available during the course of the sprint. i.e. Over a two week sprint there are ten working days (Mon - Fri). If there are 6 team members the team has a capacity of 60 story points. However if there are events such as PTO, training, scheduled appointments or planned company days the capacity should be adjusted.

It is important to remember that the figures given for each user story are an estimate and shouldnt be considered as cast in stone, as the user story is developed there may be additional work required as a result of the changes being made.


# Best Practices for Task Estimation:

Task Estimation for the Sprint should take place during the Sprint Planning Meeting with the whole team being present at the meeting.

The Scrum Master should have the Sprint Backlog prepared for the Sprint Planning Meeting.
