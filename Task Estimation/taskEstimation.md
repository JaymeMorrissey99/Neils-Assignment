# Task Estimation

Task Estimation is the Scrum technique used to estimate the length of time a piece of work will take to complete.

The objective is to estimate the amount of time a user story will take to complete based on the priority, complexity or scale of a story and by the time box of the Sprint.

Story Points are the designation given to the amount of time to be allocated to a user story. Story Points are used to understand the relative levels of effort for a user story in comparison to other user stories.

It is important during task estimation to calculate the amount of work the team working on the sprint can achieve during the timebox of the sprint.
