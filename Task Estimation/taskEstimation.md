# Task Estimation

Task Estimation is the Scrum technique used to estimate the length of time a piece of work will take to complete.

The objective is to estimate the amount of time a user story will take to complete based on the priority, complexity or scale of a story and by the time box of the Sprint.

Story Points are the designation given to the amount of time to be allocated to a user story. Story Points are used to understand the relative levels of effort for a user story in comparison to other user stories.

It is important during task estimation to calculate the amount of work the team working on the sprint can achieve during the timebox of the sprint.

To calculate the number of story points a team can complete during a sprint you add the number of days each team member is available during the course of the sprint. i.e. Over a two week sprint there are ten working days (Mon - Fri). If there are 6 team members the team has a capacity of 60 story points. However if there are events such as PTO, training, scheduled appointments or planned company days the capacity should be adjusted.

It is important to remember that the figures given for each user story are an estimate and shouldnt be considered as cast in stone, as the user story is developed there may be additional work required as a result of the changes being made.


# Best Practices for Task Estimation:

Task Estimation for the Sprint should take place during the Sprint Planning Meeting with the whole team being present at the meeting.

The Scrum Master should have the Sprint Backlog prepared for the Sprint Planning Meeting.

Story Points should be based on a numeric sizing system from 1 to 10 and should have a value of 1 Story Point is equal to 1 day of work.

The team should calculate their capacity before applying story points to user stories.

A typical Sprint should have a timebox of two weeks.

The team must come to a consensus on the number of story points allocated to a user story by means of voting. If an explanation for a suggested value is required by the scrum master, the team member should provide the relevant reasons for their suggested number of story points. 

If there are additional tasks that have been moved to the next sprint in the Product Backlog but the team has available capacity they should pull in additional user stories into the Sprint Backlog. 

If a user story has become more complex as it is being developed and the team member assigned to the user story feels that the estimate needs to be updated they should explain their reasons for this estimation change at the next Daily Stand Up Meeting. 

At the end of the Sprint the team must complete a Sprint Retrospective Meeting to examine their Sprint Velocity, this can help to improve task estimation in the future. 
This gives the Product Owner and other stakeholders an idea of the project duration.
